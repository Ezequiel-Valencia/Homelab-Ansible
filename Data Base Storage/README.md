# NAS
A NAS is network accessed storage and is typically a stand alone device that manages the storage needs required. It can be used to help create redundant storage, be a storage pool itself, or both a storage pool and redundant storage.

### Potential NAS
There are plenty of different methods for creating a NAS.

- Synology seems to expensive and hand held. There does not seem to be a lot of bad reputation around it, but again that price tag.

- QNAP does seem to be a cheap alternative to Synology, but it does not seem to have a great reputation unfortionately. https://youtu.be/xyFzyQWSl78

- Self made NAS does not seem to bad, only issue would be small form factor :/

Currently my thought would be to create self made NAS, and take the hit for size.

### Storage medium
Buying used hard drives is way to sketchy, plus the life span may be significantly reduced. Instead just buy some NAS Segate IronWolf drives.

## What is Nextcloud
A service that uses some data pool, and shares it with others. This can also include calanders, contacts, and more.
